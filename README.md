# Google satellite embeddings - R Workflow

Get ready for a revolution in remote sensing! Google has just unveiled an incredible update: Earth Engine now features annual 10 m Satellite Embeddings (64 bands per pixel) fueled by the groundbreaking AlphaEarth Foundations model! This means you can effortlessly perform classification, change detection, regression, and similarity search without the hassle of training heavy models. In my latest video, I'll guide you through the exciting process of running the same workflow in Râ€”loading the embeddings, sampling, k-means clustering, and visualizing the stunning results.
